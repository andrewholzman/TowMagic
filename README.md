# TowMagic

- Persistance: using MySql through Hibernate. To create DB, run the sql script towmagic-DBSeed - contains tables, stored procedures and basic seed data. Note: currently using root sql user temporarily

Note: Need to investigate, but sometimes when doing a maven install, it fails the first time and succeeds the second time.
If you see it fail, try running mavin install again
